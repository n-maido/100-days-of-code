# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: October 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Troubleshooted some compilation errors-ended up reverting some overloaded ops to the original implementation. Brainstormed the execution flow for the whole program, as well as walkIn.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I took a while to get my bearings and re-understand my code, as well as c++.
